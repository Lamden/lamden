## CONTRIBUTION GUIDELINES

Thank you for your interest in Lamden. We welcome pull requests from developers at all skill levels.
To start fork the master branch from GitHub into your personal account. 
Then clone the fork onto your local machine.
Make sure you [configure a remote](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/) for your fork to [sync changes](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) you make with the original repository.

### SETUP
See [installation instructions](https://github.com/Lamden/cilantro_ee#installing).  
We recommend using a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.   
Make sure to pull often. Cilantro is in very active state of development.

### PULL REQUESTS
Feel free to submit pull requests. We will appreciate it.  
Not sure if issue is significant enough to create a PR? Create it anyway and we will review. 
If your feature is definitely bigger, please document it under "issues" first, before working on it so the dev team can have a look at it to make sure it ties in well 
with the rest of the code and that your time is not wasted. Don't give up if your PR is not accepted, nothing personal, it is usually because of a technical reason. Keep on, your contribution and effort are valuable :)  
With bugs, If you are willing to dig a bit deeper and do some exploratory debugging or are willing to fix a bug, go for it!

If you report an issue and you have a choice between writing up a short one-liner or a bit more exploratory digging in, the latter is encouraged as it gives better clues to developers to resolve it.

### TESTS
TBD
