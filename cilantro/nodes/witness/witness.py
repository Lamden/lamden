"""
    Witness

    Witnesses exist primarily to check the validity of proofs of transactions sent out by masternodes.
    They subscribe to masternodes on the network, confirm the hashcash style proof provided by the sender is valid, and
    then go ahead and pass the transaction along to delegates to include in a block. They will also facilitate
    transactions that include stake reserves being spent by users staking on the network.
