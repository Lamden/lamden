'''
    Witness
    
    Witnesses exist primarily to check the validity of proofs of transactions sent out by masternodes. 
    They subscribe to masternodes on the network, confirm the hashcash style proof provided by the sender is valid, and
    then go ahead and pass the transaction along to delegates to include in a block. They will also facilitate 
    transactions that include stake reserves being spent by users staking on the network.

# include safeguard to make sure witness and masternode start at the same time and no packets are lost
# add broker based solution to ensure dynamic discovery  - solved via masternode acting as bootnode
# add proxy/broker based solution to ensure dynamic discovery between witness and delegate
